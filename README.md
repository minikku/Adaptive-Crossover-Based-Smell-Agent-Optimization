# Adaptive-Crossover-Based-Smell-Agent-Optimization
This work proposes the Adaptive Crossover-Based Smell Agent Optimization (ACB-SAO) algorithm, inspired by olfactory senses. Key innovations include a Linnik Flight-based exploration mode with a golden ratio setup for enhanced exploration and a dynamic crossover rate adjustment to boost optimization performance.
